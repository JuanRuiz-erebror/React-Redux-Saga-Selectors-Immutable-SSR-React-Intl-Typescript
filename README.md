# React - Redux - Saga - Selectors -Immutable - ssr - React Intl - Typescript. The ultimate React Boilerplate!!

**Another React boilerplate?**

In each project, we can continue to improve and refine our way of creating and maintaining an application. This boilerplate is the result of finding a balance between practicality, simplicity and foresight to create a scalable and maintainable application
